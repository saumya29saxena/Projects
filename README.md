# Cricket Score Predictor  

This project is centered around developing a robust machine learning model to predict the scores of **Men's T20 World Cup** matches. Given the fast-paced and dynamic nature of T20 cricket, accurately predicting scores involves analyzing various factors, including player performance, pitch conditions, weather, and historical match data.  

The primary objective is to build a predictive model that estimates the final scores of a team batting first in a T20 match. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques such as **XGBoost** for training and **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing, the model aims to provide accurate predictions. These insights can assist teams, coaches, and analysts in strategic decision-making.  

## Features  
- Predict scores for Men's T20 World Cup matches based on match details.  
- Built using **XGBoost** for training and **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing.  
- Simple and user-friendly interface for quick predictions.
